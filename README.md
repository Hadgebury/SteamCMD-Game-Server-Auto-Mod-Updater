# STEAMCMD Mod Updater for Game Servers

This script helps you automatically update mods for your STEAMCMD-based game server by downloading mods from the Steam Workshop. It checks the latest versions of mods, updates them, and ensures only the latest versions are present on your server.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

- **STEAMCMD**: STEAMCMD must be installed and available on your server.
- **Game ID**: Replace the placeholder `<GAME_ID>` in the script with your game's Steam App ID. You can find the Steam App ID on the [Steam Database](https://steamdb.info/).
- **Server Setup**: The script assumes your server has a structure where mods are stored in a specific directory. Ensure the `MODS_DIR` variable is set correctly to where you want to store mods.

## Setup

### 1. Clone this Repository

Clone the repository to your server by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/steamcmd-mod-updater.git
cd steamcmd-mod-updater
```

2. Edit the Script
Open the script file (mod_updater.sh) and update the following variables:

GAME_ID: Replace <GAME_ID> with the correct Steam App ID for your game. You can find this ID on the Steam Database.

MODS_DIR: Ensure this is set to the directory where you want the mods to be installed on your server.

MODLIST_FILE: Make sure this file contains a list of mod IDs you wish to download. Each mod ID should be on a separate line.

3. Make the Script Executable
Ensure the script has execute permissions by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x mod_updater.sh
4. Run the Script
Once the script is configured, you can run it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
./mod_updater.sh
5. Automate the Script
To keep your mods updated automatically, consider adding the script to a cron job or your server's startup process.

For example, to run the script every day at 2:00 AM, add a cron job by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
crontab -e
And add this line:

bash
Copy
Edit
0 2 * * * /path/to/mod_updater.sh
How It Works
Mod List: You provide a list of mod IDs in modlist.txt. These are the mods that the script will check and update.

SteamCMD: The script uses SteamCMD to download the latest versions of mods from the Steam Workshop based on the mod IDs.

Version Control: The script computes a hash of the downloaded mod and compares it with the stored hash from the previous run. If a new version is found, it will replace the old version.

Cleanup: Old or missing mods that are no longer in modlist.txt are automatically removed from the server to avoid unnecessary files taking up space.

Configuration
Hereâ€™s a list of the important configuration variables that you can modify:

STEAMCMD: Path to your SteamCMD installation (/home/container/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh by default).

GAME_ID: Replace <GAME_ID> with your Steam App ID.

MODS_DIR: The directory where the mods will be installed on your server. The default is /home/container/Mods.

MODLIST_FILE: The path to the file that contains the list of mod IDs you want to install/update (/home/container/modlist.txt by default).

HASH_FILE: The file where mod hashes are stored to check for updates (/home/container/modhashes.txt by default).

FOLDER_MAP_FILE: The file where mod folder mappings are stored (/home/container/modfolders.txt by default).
